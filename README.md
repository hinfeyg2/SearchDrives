Drive Library
=============

For use in the Film/Television Post Production industry.

This is a Python/wxPython program which allows you to list all files on a drive and add that list to a sqlite database.
The list of files is also added with more user inputted data, drive number, job name and a automatically added timestamp.
Once in the database drives can be searched for particular files without needed to re connect the drive.
This is useful for conforming a single program from rushes spread across multiple drives.

One missing feature is the ability to input into the library an Edit Decision List.
I would like to be able to query the database using an EDL so I would know specifically which drives are needed for conform.
